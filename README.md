# Libft -Custom C Library Functions

Welcome to the **Libft** project! ðŸŽ‰  
This project is an exploration into the world of C programming, where Iâ€™ve recreated many functions found in the basic C libraries. Itâ€™s designed to deepen my understanding of how these essential building blocks work under the hood.


## Why This Project?

- Learn by recreating standard C functions.
- Understand implementation details and edge cases.
- Practice and improve C programming skills.

## Whatâ€™s Included?

The project includes custom versions of functions for:

- **String Manipulation:** `strlen`, `strjoin`, `strlcat`
- **Memory Management:** `malloc`, `calloc`
- **Input/Output:** `printf`
- and more!

Thank you for visiting, and happy coding! ðŸš€
